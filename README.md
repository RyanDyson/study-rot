# Ryan's NEXT Boilerplate

This is a template / boilerplate for web application using my preferred technologies. Some basics are already set up like sign-in, sign-up pages and some basic navbar for landing page and dashboard. 

Built for B2B SaaS and Hackathons because I'm lazy. 

## Technology Stack

This is more of a batteries included approach to NEXT. If you wish to go over and choose your own stack, better to not use this template.
